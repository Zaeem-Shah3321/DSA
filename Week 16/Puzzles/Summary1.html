                WHAT IS A GRAPH? <br>

                A linear† graph (or simply a graph) G = (V, E) consists of a set of objects V =
                {v1 v2
                , . . .} called vertices, and another set E = {e1’ e2
                ,. . .}, whose elements are
                called edges, such that each edge ek
                is identified with an unordered pair (vi
                , vj
                ) of
                vertices
                <br>
                <br>
            <li>FINITE AND INFINITE GRAPHS <br>
                
                Although in our definition of a graph neither the vertex set V nor the edge set
                E need be finite, in most of the theory and almost all applications these sets are
                finite. A graph with a finite number of vertices as well as a finite number of
                edges is called a finite graph; otherwise, it is an infinite graph. 
                <br>
                <br>

                <li>A vertex having no incident edge is called an isolated vertex. <br>

                    <li>A vertex of degree one is called a pendant vertex
or an end vertex.  <br>
                        <li> A graph without any edges, is called a null graph. <br><br>
                            <li>. SUBGRAPHS <br>
                                A graph g is said to be a subgraph of a graph G if all the vertices and all the
                                edges of g are in G, and each edge of g has the same end vertices in g as in G. <br>

                                <li> 1]. Every graph is its own subgraph.
<br>
2]. A subgraph of a subgraph of G is a subgraph of G.
<br>3]. A single vertex in a graph G is a subgraph of G.
<br>
4]. A single edge in G, together with its end vertices, is also a subgraph <br>
<br>
                                    <li> WALK <br>

                                        A walk is defined as a finite alternating sequence of vertices and edges,
                                        beginning and ending with vertices, such that each edge is incident with the
                                        vertices preceding and following it. No edge appears (is covered or traversed)
                                        more than once in a walk. <br><br>

                                        <li>Vertices with which a walk begins and ends are called its terminal vertices.
                                            Vertices v1 and v5 are the terminal vertices of the walk. It is
                                            possible for a walk to begin and end at the same vertex. Such a walk is called a
                                            closed walk. A walk that is not closed (i.e., the terminal vertices are distinct) is
                                            called an open walk <br> <br></br>
                                            <li>    An open walk in which no vertex appears more than once is called a path <br>
                                                <li>A closed walk in which no vertex (except the initial and the final vertex)
                                                    appears more than once is called a circuit <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                    <li>A circuit is also called a cycle, elementary cycle, circular path, and polygon.
In electrical engineering a circuit is sometimes referred to as a loop—not to be
confused with self-loop. (Every self-loop is a circuit, but not every circuit is a
self-loop.) <br><br>


                                                        <li>A graph is connected if
                                                            we can reach any vertex from any other vertex by traveling along the edges.
                                                            More formally:
                                                            A graph G is said to be connected if there is at least one path between every
                                                            pair of vertices in G. Otherwise, G is disconnected. <br>
                                                            <br>

                                                            <li>If a graph (connected or disconnected) has exactly two vertices of odd degree,
there must be a path joining these two vertices. <br> <br>
                                                                <li>graph G is it possible to find a closed walk running through every edge of G
                                                                    
                                                                    exactly once? Such a walk is now called an Euler line, and a graph that consists
                                                                    of an Euler line is called an Euler graph. More formally:
                                                                    If some closed walk in a graph contains all the edges of the graph, then the
                                                                    walk is called an Euler line and the graph an Euler graph. <br><br>
                                                                    
                                                                    
                                                                    <li>A given connected graph G is an Euler graph if and only if all vertices of G
                                                                        are of even degree. <br><br>
                                                                        <li>Hamiltonian circuit in a connected graph is defined as a closed walk that
                                                                            traverses every vertex of G exactly once, except of course the starting vertex, at
                                                                            which the walk also terminates <br><br>
                                                                            <li>A circuit in a connected graph G is said to be Hamiltonian if it includes every
                                                                                vertex of G. Hence a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph of n vertices consists of
                                                                                exactly n edges. <br><br>

                                                                                <li>Hamiltonian Path: If we remove any one edge from a Hamiltonian circuit, we
are left with a path. This path is called a Hamiltonian path. <br>  <br>
                                                                                   <li>In considering the existence of a Hamiltonian circuit (or path), we need only
                                                                                    consider simple graphs. This is because a Hamiltonian circuit (or path) traverses
                                                                                    every vertex exactly once. <br><br>
                                                                                        <li>Complete Graph: A simple graph in which there exists an edge between every
                                                                                            pair of vertices is called a complete graph. <br> <br>
                                                                                            <li>In a complete graph with n vertices there are (n − l)/2 edge-disjoint
                                                                                                Hamiltonian circuits, if n is an odd number ≥ 3. <br><br>

                                                                                                <li>TREES <br>
A tree is a connected graph without any circuits. The graph in  for
instance, is a tree. Trees with one, two, three, and four vertices are shown in As pointed out in Chapter 1, a graph must have at least one vertex, and
therefore so must a tree. Some authors allow the null tree, a tree without any
vertices. We have excluded such an entity from being a tree. Similarly, as we are
considering only finite graphs, our trees are also finite. <br><br>
                                                                                                    <li>1].There is one and only one path between every pair of vertices in a tree, T. <br>
                                                                                                            2]. If in a graph G there is one and only one path between every pai of vertices,
                                                                                                            G is a tree. <br>
                                                                                                            3]. A tree with n vertices has n − 1 edges. <br>
                                                                                                            4]. Any connected graph with n vertices and n − 1 edges is a tree. <br>
                                                                                                            5]. A graph is a tree if and only if it is minimally connected. <br>
                                                                                                            6]. A graph G with n vertices, n − 1 edges, and no circuits is connected.
